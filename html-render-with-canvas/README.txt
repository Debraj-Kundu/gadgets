This renders html tags including <ul>,<li>,<b>,<i>,<u>,<p> in html5 canvas,in a loop way.Most of invalid and iregular syntax style parsing and rendering is supported,if not all,referenced on the behavior of chrome36.So browers work on this need to support html5 canvas tag.A simple and naive jQuery-like lib is provided aimed to simplify dom operation.The jQuery-like considered supporting for IE7,as it seemes much bigger than it should be.It is writtened when I engaged in another project,which required IE7 supporting.
